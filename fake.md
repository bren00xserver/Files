Hello people of the jailbreak community. I am going to expose [@coffeebreakerz](https://twitter.com/coffeebreakerz)! Also, some bonuses, [@JosephShenton](https://twitter.com/JosephShenton), and [@hollr2099](https://twitter.com/hollr2099)! All of the people I'm about to expose have blocked me on twitter, along with their friends, so please tweet this at them. Let's begin.


Ooh, other times they've been exposed. First, read [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/jailbreak/comments/5ubuyd/news_small_jb_team_coffeebreakerz_bypassed_kpp_on/). Qwerty is a reputable figure, who has released jailbreaks. His points are valid, and shows that their stuff shown on their website is false. A further look through the thread shows 90% of replies saying they're fake. Any other replies thinking they were real shows how gullible the jailbreak community is.


The origins of this super fake team are as follows, their first tweet was [this](https://twitter.com/coffeebreakerz/status/831962139342561280). Where they asked for money. They have actually gotten money from people in the jailbreak community, which allowed them to buy iOS devices. This makes me mad because people actually donated. If you check replies on that tweet, qwerty also had some words for him. Qwerty basically roasted him. They tried covering shit up after that, but failed. If you go back to some of their first tweets, his responses to qwerty roasting him are shown [here](http://prntscr.com/ezn3z5). This cover-up is not sufficient, and anyone not desperate would understand not to trust him. His response made it worse, he said he didn't do it for money, but his first tweet was asking for it, and said qwerty screwed over their exploits by exposing them? False.


These "Security Researchers" for iOS also don't know how to create a Debian repository (Cydia repositories are based off of Debian repositories), so they had to use a template. ([Image](https://twitter.com/coffeebreakerz/status/832378317877739521)) They also posted [this](https://ghostbin.com/paste/vg6sd), which is probably absolute bullshit, or another program, that has false positives. If they're Security Researchers like they claim to be, they should be able to decompress the kernel, and throw it in to a disassembler, they also should need to be able to make their own exploits, and not steal from Google Project Zero, or try to give out prizes for bugs. Very qualified in these departments, eh?


They love to post images of their home screen with apps that have no icons, well, we have all of those apps, and they do about nothing. Also, they crash their own apps and call it a kernel exploit. They also love to open IDA PRO, show a random method, and say something like "I think I found a bufferoverflow!", when sometimes it's not even dealing with stuff like that. If you want to see more though, just look at their twitter. It's basically more stupid fake shit. You might have to stop like me though, since I think I lost all my brain cells.


I have requested them to do challenges that would prove they're legit, and they'd decline each one. Soon I decided to troll them, and wasted their time with 2 fake exploits I made in 10 minutes on my iPhone. They got mad and tried to say I didn't know what I was talking about and stuff like that. I was laughing my ass off. I also exposed them saying how their shit was fake, and soon enough, they blocked me. Since they blocked me, and didn't want my gift, I will release it here, an archive of everything on coffeebreakerz stackstorage. Have fun. Mess with the best, get rekt like the rest. [(Archive Link)](https://enduniverse.com/exploits/coffeebreakers.zip). MD5: [2d86f14decaaa8091e3ab87cc29664ed]; SHA1: [7f0403a8fcf28856afc6498d6a048d3edfd2297a]; SHA256: [3e4a0a3dffa3ab013d58c923c8041ede084171c11b22dd37fcdb45ca9d520eb6]; (Mirror this if you want since it may be taken down in a bit)


Now, enough with coffee, we don't have to cook him up anymore, now we're gonna expose Joseph. Joseph is apart of coffeebreakerz, calls himself a Developer and Security Researcher, and loves to contradict himself. Most of his tweets are deleted, so any proof is gonna be after Flavour was made. First of all, he's been like a messenger for coffee, first, when they "disassembled" Mixtape Player, they thought stripped symbols was a kernel exploit, which is false. I don't have proof of that right now, but I bet you can find that if you dig deep. He also loves to act childish on twitter. He also likes to spend money for no reason.


Flavour is just a disaster, first Joe knows nothing about security, and his PR is crap. He calls people rude names whenever they call him out. He's also manually signing stuff, which if you're gonna operate a signing service, you need to have stuff be automatic, or it will not play out well. Also, he leaks UDIDs, and when people tell him ways to not do so, he gets mad and calls them a moron. I had a chat with him a couple days ago, which you can read [here](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZeNhc). Started with the coffeebreakerz team, and see he said he made exploits, but soon he will say that he's not a security researcher. If you look the conversation went from coffeebreakerz, to Flavour, where I criticized leaking UDIDs, which I made a tool to get [here](https://enduniverse.com/exploits/flavour). I also criticized his use of a Mac with a GUI, which was mentioned by [/u/nullpixel](https://reddit.com/u/nullpixel). As you see, he cussed me out many times, and called me many vulgar names, which shows he is incapable of owning a service like Flavour.


I have nothing else to say about these people because I would end up killing more brain cells than intended. This is just to end coffeebreakers, and expose them for what they are: Nothing.

~~Bonus read: [@hollr2099](https://twitter.com/hollr2099) exposed?~~ This no longer applies, because this user shut down his site hours after writing , if you still want to read, continue on.


So, apparently people were mirroring his iPAs, he released a "fix", and I said it's not proper, where he then gone on to block me, due to this, I have created something, that will allow that to prosper.

So, if you were accessing:

change to 


> https://enduniverse.com/exploits/h29/ipas/2600.emu%20v1.5.29.ipa


If someone tries to help, and you don't accept it, bad things may happen.


NOTE: I didn't use his site for malicious reasons prior to this, nor do I have anything against this dude, or this read might have been longer.

DISCLAIMER: All information obtained has been done in a fully legal manner.


TL;DR I expose @coffeebreakerz for being fake, @JosephShenton for his shitty signing service, and @hollr2099 for not taking the help he needs, but he's already shut down his site by the time this was released.


Thank you for reading this long ass post, and I hope you enjoyed another exposing by DillanCodez. Please be wise. Stay safe! Also, follow me on twitter, at [@DillanCodez](https://twitter.com/DillanCodez)
